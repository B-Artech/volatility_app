# Stock Daily Return Distribution App
> Is a Dash-based web application that visualizes and analyzes the daily return distribution of a user-specified stock.
The app calculates:
>  logarithmic daily returns,
> high-to-low simple return and Open to Close simple returns,
>  displaying them in three interactive histograms with return statistics and standard deviation levels.

* It provides a statistical summary in tables, showing metrics like mean returns, frequency of positive/negative returns, and standard deviation bounds for volatility.
* The cumulative return for the selected period is displayed prominently.
* The app offers a clear and insightful way to explore asset historical performance.
